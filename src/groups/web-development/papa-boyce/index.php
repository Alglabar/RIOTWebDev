				I was only nine years old. 
				I loved Boyce so much, I had all the hard and soft ware. 
				I'd pray to Boyce every night before I go to bed, thanking for the life I've been given. 
				"Boyce is love", I would say, "Boyce is life". 
				My dad hears me and calls me a faggot. 
				I knew he was just jealous for my devotion of Boyce. 
				I called him a cunt. 
				He slaps me and sends me to go to sleep. 
				I'm crying now and my face hurts. 
				I lay in bed and it's really cold. 
				A warmth is moving towards me. 
				I feel something touch me. 
				It's Boyce. 
				I'm so happy. 
				He whispers in my ear, "This is my group". 
				He grabs me with his powerful homosexual hands, and puts me on my hands and knees. 
				I spread my ass-cheeks for Boyce. 
				He penetrates my butthole. 
				It hurts so much, but I do it for Boyce. 
				I can feel my butt tearing as my eyes start to water. 
				I push against his force. 
				I want to please Boyce. 
				He roars a mighty roar, as he fills my butt with his love. 
				My dad walks in. 
				Boyce looks him straight in the eye, and says, "It's all in memory now". 
				Boyce leaves through my window. 
				Boyce is love. 
				Boyce is life.ï»¿
